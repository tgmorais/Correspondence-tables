# Correspondence-tables
This is a work space for the correspondence tables working group for BONSAI hackathon 2019 [hackathon2019](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/hackathon-2019). The ongoig discussion of the group on this topic is [here](https://bonsai.groups.io/g/hackathon2019/topic/30417494?p=,,,20,0,0,0::relevance,,%23correspondencetables,20,2,0,30417494,ct=1&ct=1)

## Background
BONSAI will draw data from multiple sources, e.g. national supply-use tables, statistical databases etc. These have their own native classification to define products, activities, elementary flows or, generally speaking,  objects/activity flows.
The integration of these data requires correspondence tables. These establish a correspondence between the different names and classifications of flow-objects, activities and properties.

## Defining goals and objectives

The goal of this working group is to collect and classify correspondence tables between existing classifications, distinguishing between products, activities and elementary flows and to convert the correspondence tables in RDF format for entry into the database. 
All correpsondence tables shall be in machine-readable format. The correspondence tables currently available are uploaded above.

In order to keep track of what correspondence tables are available, all developments on the correspondence tables (e.g. add new table, change status of existing file etc) shall be reported in the overview file above named _Overview_of_available_correspondence_files 

## Hackathon Deliverables

These can be grouped into "before", "during", and "stretch" goals.

### Before the hackathon

* Collect and classify in this directory existing correspondence tables, distinguishing between activities, products and elementary flows tables (converted in csv) previously on the BONSAI goolge drive. (DONE) 
* Upload the converted tables in this directory and delete them from the goolge drive (after a month). (DONE)
* Add missing classification, if any.
* Discuss and provide recommendations on dealing with 1-N, N-1, M-N situations

### During the hackathon

Convert the correspondence tables in RDF format for entry into the database.

### Stretch goals

 Expand the correspondence tables converted in RDF format to allow traversing as many classifications as possible.
